            <p>Welcome to my site! Since graduating from Drexel University, with a Bachelor's Degree in Interactive Digital Media, I can still be found sitting in front of my computer screen working on front end development, perfecting my skills with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and building fast interactive layouts. Or, in front of my TV playing the latest video games. Away from the screen, the Schuylkill River Trail has the best views, perfect for a run and a craft brew to cool off.</p>
