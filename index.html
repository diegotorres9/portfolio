            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I'm a Front End Web Developer in the Philadelphia area. I have a bachelor's degree in Interactive Digital Media
                from Drexel University. I began diving into the world of web development about four years ago and have been
                continuing to expand my knowledge of web development in and out of the classroom. In my free time I like
                to play video games, run, and spend time with my family and friends.</p>
